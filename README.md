## Overview

Owiwi is a library for initializing tracing subscriber with OpenTelemetry


## Usage

To use `owiwi`, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
owiwi = "0.2"
tracing = "0.1"
```

Then initiate the subscriber using the `init()` method

```rust
use owiwi::Owiwi

fn main() {
  // Initialize the subscriber with an exporter that prints telemetry
  // (logs, metrics and traces) to the standard output.
  Owiwi::init("demo-service");
  tracing::info!("All good!");
}
```

You can also initialize the subscriber in asynchronous code.

```rust
use owiwi::Owiwi
use tracing::info;

async fn main() {
  // Initialize the subscriber with an exporter that prints telemetry
  // (logs, metrics and traces) to the standard output.
  Owiwi::init("demo-service");
  tracing::info!("All good!");
}
```

The optional `bon` feature allows initializing the subscriber with non default exporter.

## Optional features
By default `owiwi` depends on `clap` and `serde`. There are optional features that enable 
- `bon` adds [`bon::Builder`](https://docs.rs/bon/latest/bon/derive.Builder.html) implementation for [`TracerProviderOptions`](https://docs.rs/owiwi/latest/owiwi/provider/struct.TracerProviderOptions.html) and [`Owiwi`](https://docs.rs/owiwi/latest/owiwi/struct.Owiwi.html)

## Supported Rust Versions
`Owiwi` currently only support the latest stable version.
